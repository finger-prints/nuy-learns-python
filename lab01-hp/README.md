# HP lab

In this lab, we're going to make a little game.

## Setup
There's a player and an enemy in the dimmsdale dimmadimmadome who have to fight
to the death. The player has a number of potions and the ability to fight... now
they just have to make the right choices to win.

## Your Job
The code for the game lives in [hp.py](./hp.py). Finish writing the functions
defined towards the beginning of the file. The game should run as is, but of
course the mechanics won't work until you've implemented those functions. So you
should be able to test mechanics as you go...

## Running Your Code
You can take the `hp.py` starter script however you want - copy and paste,
github raw download, git clone (if you feel like installing git ahead of time).
Then you should be able to run it like before: `python3 hp.py`
